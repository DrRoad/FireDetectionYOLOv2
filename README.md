# Fire Detection for CCTV surveillance system using Deep Learning

Demo for CCTV surveillance system using Deep Learning
- Needs from the construction industry
- Applying deep learning to Video streams from CCTV
- YOLOv2 deep learning model implemented to detect fire from video stream

Suitable to suggest deep learning workflow with our tool
1. Access data : imagedatastore
2. Labeling data : Automatic fire labeling class for image labeler defined using image processing apps, e.g. color thresholder, image segmenter
3. Training : YOLOv2 training using vehicle detect yolov2 network
4. Deployment : Inference speed acceleration by generating mex file for real-time prediction

Detailed slides are included in the folder for guidance and demonstration.
